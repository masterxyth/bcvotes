   <h2>Politics and Government of British Columbia</h2>
      <h3>How does the provincial government work?</h3>
      <h4>Written by Gustavo Destro</h4>

      <p>
The politics of British Columbia is similar to other Canadian provinces as it resembles the Federal Government.
Representation of citizens within the province is achieved in the form of a <b>Westminster-style unicameral</b> parliament divided into two powers: The Legislative Assembly and the Queen of Canada. <br />
</p>
<p>

The <b>>Queen of Canada, Elizabeth II</b>, is head of state for British Columbia but, since the signing of the articles of Confederation in 1871, most of her powers are allocated to the office of the <b>Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia</b>, who represent the Crown in provincial politics. The Lieutenant Governor’s main political roles are to maintain continuous and stable government, and to act as a non-partisan guarantor against abuses of power. However, these powers are only used in extraordinary times, and for the most part the Lieutenant General undertakes ceremonial roles.<br /></p>

<p>

True political power is vested upon the provincial <b>Legislative Assembly.</b> The Legislature consists of 85 Members of the <b>Legislative Assembly (MLA)</b> allocated seats for ridings distributed across the province. As the system is based on the Westminster-style, the BC Assembly functions much like the Federal House of Representatives, where the party with the most seats selects a Premier and an Executive Council.<br /></p>
<p>


The <b>Premier</b> is the head of government and chief executive – in all but name – of the province. Though the Premier can be any member of the winning party, convention has been established that the leader of the party will take the position after elections. Though she receives her authority from the Crown, the Premier holds executive authority to govern through her cabinet and her MLAs. These relationships are crucial, for the loss of authority by the Premier can lead to her removal from a position of leadership. The Premier guides and directs the actions of the ruling party, and consequently the provincial government, in matters of developing and introducing policies and directives, and in presenting these to the province’s public.<br /></p>

<p>

Aiding the Premier more directly in governance is the <b>Executive Council</b>, the provincial government’s cabinet. The Council is made up of MLAs selected by the Premier and are confirmed and officially appointed by the Lieutenant Governor. Cabinet members are most often, though not always, heads of a <b>Ministry</b>, responsible for different governmental responsibilities, called “portfolios.” Like in most provinces the most important Ministries are of Finance and Health, however exclusively in British Columbia the Forestry portfolio holds equally great importance because of the industry’s oversized role in BC’s economy.
<br /></p>

<p>

All these roles and posts are determined after elections are held. Elections in British Columbia are held every four years, on the "second Tuesday in May in the fourth calendar year following the general voting day for the most recently held general election." This system of fixed election dates was the first in Canadian provinces. Election is done by a <b>First-Past-the-Post</b> system per riding, meaning that the party that gains 43 or more ridings gains a majority, independent of popular vote percentages. For example, if Party A wins two ridings by 51%-49% margin, and loses another by a 10%-90% margin, it still has a majority of seats even though it retains a smaller percentage share. This helps explain how in the 2009 elections the Liberal Party won 49 ridings with 45.8% of the vote, while in 2013 it retained the 49 seats, but with a decreased share of the popular vote of 44.1%.
